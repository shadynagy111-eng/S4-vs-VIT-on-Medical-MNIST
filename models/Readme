🛠️ Typical Workflow
Each notebook is structured to facilitate reproducibility. By running the cells sequentially, the following pipeline is executed:

1. Data Pipeline
Ingestion: Downloads the specified MedMNIST dataset via the medmnist API.

2D-to-1D Mapping: Implements the Raster Scan strategy to flatten spatial data into a sequence suitable for S4D processing.

Normalization: Applies dataset-specific mean/std normalization.

2. Model Architecture
S4D Core: Initializes the Diagonal State Space kernel using the HiPPO matrix.

Residual Blocks: Implements the linear projections and GELU activations shown in the architecture diagrams.

Classification Head: Maps the sequence-aggregate representation to the class probability distribution.

3. Evaluation & Visualization
Benchmarking: Measures Peak VRAM and Throughput using custom hooks.

Plotting: Generates the Confusion Matrices and Training Trajectories found in the main paper.
