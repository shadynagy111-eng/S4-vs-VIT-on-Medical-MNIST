📓 Experiment NotebooksThis directory contains the core implementation and experimental workflows for evaluating Structured State Space Models (S4D) and Vision Transformers (ViT) on medical imaging datasets.📂 Notebook CatalogNotebook FileDatasetResolutionFocus AreaS4D_OrganAMNIST_64.ipynbOrganAMNIST$64 \times 64$Scaling & Multi-class (11) stabilityS4D_DermaMNIST_64.ipynbDermaMNIST$64 \times 64$Fine-grained texture classificationS4D_PathMNIST_28.ipynbPathMNIST$28 \times 28$High-throughput sequence processingViT_Baseline_Comparison.ipynbAllMixedBaseline generation for MACs/VRAM🛠️ Typical WorkflowEach notebook is structured to facilitate reproducibility. By running the cells sequentially, the following pipeline is executed:1. Data PipelineIngestion: Downloads the specified MedMNIST dataset via the medmnist API.2D-to-1D Mapping: Implements the Raster Scan strategy to flatten spatial data into a sequence suitable for S4D processing.Normalization: Applies dataset-specific mean/std normalization.2. Model ArchitectureS4D Core: Initializes the Diagonal State Space kernel using the HiPPO matrix.Residual Blocks: Implements the linear projections and GELU activations shown in the architecture diagrams.Classification Head: Maps the sequence-aggregate representation to the class probability distribution.3. Evaluation & VisualizationBenchmarking: Measures Peak VRAM and Throughput using custom hooks.Plotting: Generates the Confusion Matrices and Training Trajectories found in the main paper.🚀 How to RunLocal EnvironmentEnsure you have the dependencies installed as per the root requirements.txt:Bashpip install -r ../requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
Google ColabTo run these on Google Colab,
upload the notebook and 
ensure you install the S4 library at the start of the session:
Python!pip install medmnist
!pip install git+https://github.com/state-spaces/s4.git
